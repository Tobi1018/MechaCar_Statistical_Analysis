## Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics, such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance, were collected for each vehicle. Using my knowledge of R, designed a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes by using several variables from the MechaCar_mpg.csv file. Then, write a short interpretation of the multiple linear regression results
